# 🔐 API Key Setup (Required)

AI Copilot needs an LLM API key to generate diagrams from natural language.

Steps:

-> AI-Copilot → Settings

-> Select your model provider

-> Paste your API key

Click Save

Generate diagram normally

No restart required.

### 🤖 Recommended Model Providers

Based on tested results and diagram quality:

✅ Preferred (Best diagram reasoning + structure):

Gemini - free

Claude - paid

⚠️ Use GPT only if needed

Works fine for simple flows

May produce weaker structure for very complex architectures compared to Claude/Gemini
as per individual experience

Step 2 — Enter diagram description using natural language.

Step 3 — Click Generate Diagram.

Step 4 — Edit shapes manually if needed (all output is standard Draw.io objects).

---

# Prompt Writing Guide

Best pattern: short step‑style flow description instead of essays.



---

## Tested Prompt Examples

You can copy paste below prompt as it is & see the magic

**Single Shapes**:
---
```
* Draw a diamond Shape
```
```
* Draw three circles named A B C
```
```
* Make one decision node called Valid?
```
---
**Basic flow:**
---
```
* Daw circle → square → diamond → database    connect all
```
```
* Draw Login flow:
User logs in → validate → if valid dashboard → else error → end
```


---
**Advanced Structures**
---

```
* Draw Start node called User Start.
Then process Validate Input.
Then decision Is Input Valid.
If yes go to Save Data.
If no go to Show Error.
Both paths end at End node
```
---
**Complex Architecture**
--

```Create a detailed architecture flow diagram for an agentic chatbot system.

Start from a UI / Web App / Corporate App where the user sends a message and later receives a response back.

Flow:

User message goes to a FastAPI chat endpoint.

From the endpoint, the message is sent to a Supervisor Router that controls routing and decisions.

The router also stores and fetches conversation context using a Memory Manager that connects to a Chat Repository and a Chat Sessions table database.

The Supervisor Router asks a decision question like “HR or IT request?” and performs intent classification.

From this decision, branch into two parallel agent paths:

Branch 1 — HR path:
Route to HR Agent.
HR Agent calls an HR Tool with parameters.
HR Tool writes data into Employee Repository.
Employee Repository stores into Employees Table database.
Results return back from HR Tool → HR Agent → LLM Client → Supervisor Router.

Branch 2 — IT path:
Route to IT Agent.
IT Agent calls an IT Tool with parameters.
IT Tool writes into IT Ticket Repository.
IT Ticket Repository stores into IT Tickets Table database.
Results return back from IT Tool → IT Agent → LLM Client → Supervisor Router.

Both HR Agent and IT Agent interact with a central LLM Client for reasoning and parameter parsing.

The LLM Client also receives past context from Chat Sessions storage.

Finally, Supervisor Router sends the final response back to FastAPI endpoint and then back to the UI app as user response.

Requirements:
- Show databases as database shapes
- Show agents and tools as process blocks
- Show router and LLM client clearly
- Show decision branching at router
- Show arrows for full round-trip flow
- Keep it as a connected architecture flow
```
---
**System Design**
---
---
```
Draw a layered GenAI architecture diagram with grouped sections and explicit connections.

GROUP: Application Startup
Framework Bootstrap -> Scan Documents Folder -> Knowledge Registry -> Ingestion Pipeline -> Vector Creation -> Vector Store

Knowledge Registry -> Ingestion Pipeline (only if new or changed)
Knowledge Registry -> Vector Store (if unchanged)

GROUP: Client / Developer Inputs
Company Documents -> Plugin Manager
Custom Functions -> Plugin Manager
Configuration YAML JSON -> Plugin Manager

GROUP: Core GenAI Framework
API Query -> Intent and Tool Router
Intent and Tool Router -> Plugin Manager

Plugin Manager -> Orchestration Engine (if plugin matched)
Plugin Manager -> Retrieval Layer (if no plugin)

Retrieval Layer -> Vector Store
Retrieval Layer -> Structured Database
Retrieval Layer -> Orchestration Engine

Orchestration Engine -> Session Memory
Orchestration Engine -> Company Context
Orchestration Engine -> Observability
Orchestration Engine -> Cost Policy Manager

Cost Policy Manager -> LLM Provider (allowed)
Cost Policy Manager -> Stop LLM Call (blocked)

LLM Provider -> Embedding Provider

GROUP: Execution Layer
External APIs -> Orchestration Engine
Orchestration Engine -> Standard Response

Standard Response -> Structured Database

Use:
- rectangles for services
- diamonds for decisions
- cylinders for databases
- grouped containers for each layer
- label decision edges: plugin matched / no plugin / allowed / blocked

```
---
## Tips for Better Results

- Use arrows or words like then, next, after
- Mention decisions explicitly
- Name components clearly
- Use yes/no branches
- Say “not connected” if no edges desired
- List architecture components and relationships

---

## Known Behavior

- Very complex diagrams need clearer step wording
- Dense graphs improve with ordered prompts
- No‑connection diagrams require explicit wording

---

## Ideal Use Cases

- Software architecture design
- Backend flow mapping
- Agent systems
- AI pipelines
- DevOps flows
- Business processes
- Decision trees
- Data pipelines
- API maps
- Tool orchestration diagrams

---

## Advantages

- Natural language driven
- No rigid syntax
- Simple to enterprise diagrams
- Clean auto layout
- Fully editable output
- Multi‑model compatible
- Fast diagram bootstrapping

FROM BASE REPO

About
----- 

**drawio-desktop** is a diagramming desktop app based on [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) that wraps the [core draw.io editor](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio).

Download built binaries from the [releases section](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases).

**Can I use this app for free?** Yes, under the apache 2.0 license. If you don't change the code and accept it is provided "as-is", you can use it for any purpose.

Security
--------

draw.io Desktop is designed to be completely isolated from the Internet, apart from the update process. This checks github.com at startup for a newer version and downloads it from an AWS S3 bucket owned by Github. All JavaScript files are self-contained, the Content Security Policy forbids running remotely loaded JavaScript.

No diagram data is ever sent externally, nor do we send any analytics about app usage externally. There is a Content Security Policy in place on the web part of the interface to ensure external transmission cannot happen, even by accident.

Security and isolating the app are the primarily objectives of draw.io desktop. If you ask for anything that involves external connections enabled in the app by default, the answer will be no.

Support
-------

Support is provided on a reasonable business constraints basis, but without anything contractually binding. All support is provided via this repo. There is no private ticketing support for non-paying users.

Purchasing draw.io for Confluence or Jira does not entitle you to commercial support for draw.io desktop.

Developing
----------

**draw.io** is a git submodule of **drawio-desktop**. To get both you need to clone recursively:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop.git`

To run this:
1. `npm install` (in the root directory of this repo)
2. [internal use only] export DRAWIO_ENV=dev if you want to develop/debug in dev mode.
3. `npm start` _in the root directory of this repo_ runs the app. For debugging, use `npm start --enable-logging`.

Note: If a symlink is used to refer to drawio repo (instead of the submodule), then symlink the `node_modules` directory inside `drawio/src/main/webapp` also.

To release:
1. Update the draw.io sub-module and push the change. Add version tag before pushing to origin.
2. Wait for the builds to complete (https://travis-ci.org/jgraph/drawio-desktop and https://ci.appveyor.com/project/davidjgraph/drawio-desktop)
3. Go to https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases, edit the preview release.
4. Download the windows exe and windows portable, sign them using `signtool sign /a /tr http://rfc3161timestamp.globalsign.com/advanced /td SHA256 c:/path/to/your/file.exe`
5. Re-upload signed file as `draw.io-windows-installer-x.y.z.exe` and `draw.io-windows-no-installer-x.y.z.exe`
6. Add release notes
7. Publish release

*Note*: In Windows release, when using both x64 and is32 as arch, the result is one big file with both archs. This is why we split them.

Local Storage and Session Storage is stored in the AppData folder:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/draw.io`
- Windows: `C:\Users\<USER-NAME>\AppData\Roaming\draw.io\`

Not open-contribution
---------------------

draw.io is closed to contributions (unless a maintainer permits it, which is extremely rare).

The level of complexity of this project means that even simple changes 
can break a _lot_ of other moving parts. The amount of testing required 
is far more than it first seems. If we were to receive a PR, we'd have 
to basically throw it away and write it how we want it to be implemented.

We are grateful for community involvement, bug reports, & feature requests. We do
not wish to come off as anything but welcoming, however, we've
made the decision to keep this project closed to contributions for 
the long term viability of the project.
